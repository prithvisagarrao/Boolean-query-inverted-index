# Boolean-query-inverted-index
### CSE535 Information Retrieval project2

- In this project given a sample input text file consisting of Doc IDs and sentence we built our own inverted index using the information extracted from the given data.
- Inverted index are stored as Linked List in memory.
- We have also implemented a Document-at-a-time strategy to return boolean query results.
- We calculate the TF-IDF(term frequency- inverse document frequency) score to rank and sort the query results.
